# Sentiment Analysis using NLP

A Machine Learning project that performs **Sentiment Analysis on textual data** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The model classifies text into sentiment categories such as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.

This project demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline including text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
